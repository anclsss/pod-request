## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email" (Oops, didn't do that ðŸ¤£)
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS (Flexbox), JS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Once again - start mobile first. Not the other way around. Background image positions. Using react hook form. 

### Continued development

It's a mess. Where to start? Not my proudest work. 

### Useful resources

- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React Forms are annoying and this helps a lot. You don't have to invent warm water.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - Love this docs. Really. 
- [create-react-app-deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) - Couldn't be thankful enough. One day I'll memorize this.
